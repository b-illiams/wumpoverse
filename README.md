Let me tell you something buddy, you came to the right place. You see this? This whole place right here? It's called the Internet. Gee, who would have wondered? But listen to this, what if I told you that there were **other Internets** out there? Now I've got your attention huh? You see, there's this world called **Discord** that's like population 250 million. Small planet, loads of cool people and stuff. In this world, there is a mythical creature called **the Wumpus**. What is it? Who cares, it's flippin' adorable and it's a cute mascot . . . *in our Internet that is*. You see, the other Internets have creatures like that too. We call em' **Wumpos**. They're big, they're mean, and not necessarily clean. Long story short . . . there ***may*** have been a small tear in the space-time continumm that caused a few wormholes to appear around Discord and now you're one of the only people that can protect humanity from the Wumpos. What, no it's not my fault! Okay . . . maybe it was . . . but I found the elixir for immortality! Yeah, there's no way I'm giving this secret sauce to you. I'll tell you what, I'll help you out a bit. You don't have much time before they take over your guild too, you need to get prepared!

## Description
Oh I forgot to tell you my name. I'm **Life or Death**, the creator of this application. I tried to find the secret of immortality through code to present it to my buddies over at **Discord** for **Hack Week 2019**. Not sure if we're still buddies. After the Wumpos took over their company, Jason won't return my calls. Hope they're doing okay. Anyways, this application is designed to ~~overrun your server with Wumpos and cause mass chaos for the people~~ assist your server by equipping it with the necessary tools to defeat the Wumpos!

## Installation
'Kay, if you want to host this bot on your own server just follow these simple dimple steps

1. Import this repository on an IDE (I would recommend Intellij or Eclipse).
2. Create a Discord Application `https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/`
3. Copy the token of your new Discord Application.
4. Open the Secret.java file in `C:\Users\Brian\IdeaProjects\wumpoverse\src\main\java\Secret.java`
5. Replace `private static final String token = "Insert token here";` with your actual token
6. Profit! You can now run the bot or make alterations to the bot to cater it to your server.

*Note:* Do not remove the quotations, add spaces, or adjust capitalizations when pasting your token on Step 5. The application will not compile

*Warning:* The bot is currently designed to be fully functional for singular server usage. It is not designed for multi server useage and was built with the knowledge that it would be utilized by a few amount of people. In future updates, I plan on increasing the scale that it can be used on.

## Usage
* You can utilize the bot within your DMs or the server you are on.
* Type .help for list of commands

## About Life or Death
A weird nerdy nerd that just graduated from Mount Olive High School and will be majoring in Computer Science in Clarkson University in the fall of 2019. He thinks he's a terrible programmer, but I'll let you be the judge of that. He's like a super freak for Discord and wants to work for the company in the future despite being across the entire country. What a weirdo. He's also never kissed a girl or a had a girlfriend. Super weirdo. Don't make fun of him @Life || Death#0001.
